        <!--game Discription-->
        FIFA 23 is a football simulation video game published by Electronic
        Arts. It is the 30th and final installment in the FIFA series that is
        developed by EA Sports, and released worldwide on 30 September 2022.
        FIFA 23 contains over 30 licensed leagues, over 100 licensed stadiums,
        over 700 clubs and more than 19,000 players. Roma, Atalanta, Lazio and
        Napoli are not featured in FIFA 23 due to their exclusivity agreements
        with rival game eFootball, and are instead known as Roma FC, Bergamo
        Calcio, Latium and Napoli FC respectively. The game retains the players'
        likenesses, but the official badge, kits and stadiums are replaced with
        custom designs and generic stadiums created by EA Sports.

          <!--More Description-->
          FIFA 23 features both men's and women's World Cup game modes,
          replicating the 2022 FIFA World Cup and the 2023 FIFA Women's World
          Cup. The game features what's being dubbed as "HyperMotion2", a system
          of match capture with machine learning from real life football matches
          to create over 6,000 in-game animations. Technical Dribbling uses what
          is being called the Active Touch system to improve the footballer's
          path to the ball and improve a player's turning and dribbling with
          more responsiveness. Both systems are exclusive to current-generation
          versions (i.e. PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Stadia and PC). This entry in the
          FIFA video game series is the first to introduce women's club
          football. England's FA Women's Super League and the French Division 1
          FÃ©minine are included at launch, with more women's football leagues
          planned to be added later on. This comes alongside Sam Kerr, who plays
          for Chelsea Women, becoming the first female footballer to feature on
          the global front cover of the game.
